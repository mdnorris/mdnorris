    I once developed a model worth several million 
    dollars to my company based on a lesson on
    penguin depopulation from high school.

### What Drives Me
I started in data science helping environmental and social justice startups, but I am also obsessively driven to learn as much as possible. I also have a middling memory, so sometimes I get to learn things twice. I'm fascinated by any and all developments in the tech field and do my best to learn as much about them before I get distracted by something else. My ultimate passion is combining what I have learned at work, from hobbies, from my friends and mentors to find exciting combinations (not necessarily in tech) that may not have been seen before.
